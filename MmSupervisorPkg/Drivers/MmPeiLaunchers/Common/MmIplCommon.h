/**
  Helper function for MM Communication protocol or PPI.

  This function provides a service to send and receive messages from a registered
  UEFI service.  This function is part of the SMM Communication Protocol that may
  be called in physical mode prior to SetVirtualAddressMap() and in virtual mode
  after SetVirtualAddressMap().

  @param[in] TalkToSupervisor    Flag to indicate if this transaction will be
                                 interfacing supervisor or users.
  @param[in, out] CommBuffer     A pointer to the buffer to convey into SMRAM.
  @param[in, out] CommSize       The size of the data buffer being passed in. On exit, the size of data
                                 being returned. Zero if the handler does not wish to reply with any data.
                                 This parameter is optional and may be NULL.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The message was successfully posted.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  The CommBuffer was NULL.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE    The buffer is too large for the MM implementation.
                                 If this error is returned, the MessageLength field
                                 in the CommBuffer header or the integer pointed by
                                 CommSize, are updated to reflect the maximum payload
                                 size the implementation can accommodate.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED      The CommunicateBuffer parameter or CommSize parameter,
                                 if not omitted, are in address range that cannot be
                                 accessed by the MM environment.
